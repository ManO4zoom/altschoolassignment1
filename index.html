      <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        My name is MarkDavid Ezeh, and I am an enthusiastic and dedicated
        learner with a strong passion for technology and cloud engineering. I
        hold a degree in Quantity Surveying from Yale University, where I
        developed a foundational understanding of computer science and
        networking. Over the years, I have gained practical experience in
        various IT roles, which has fueled my desire to specialize in cloud
        engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my previous roles, I have worked as a cybersecurity expert at
        Gomycode, where I was responsible for managing and deploying IT
        infrastructure, troubleshooting network issues, and ensuring system
        security. These experiences have given me a solid grounding in IT
        operations and have inspired me to delve deeper into the cloud computing
        domain.
      </p>

      <h2>Reasons for joining Altschool</h2>
      <p>
        I joined Alt School because I am keen to deepen my knowledge and skills
        in cloud engineering. The dynamic nature of cloud technology and its
        vast applications in todayâ€™s digital world are incredibly exciting to
        me. Alt School's comprehensive curriculum, experienced mentors, and
        hands-on approach to learning provide the perfect environment for me to
        grow as a cloud engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Alt School's emphasis on real-world projects and collaboration
        with industry experts is something that I find particularly appealing.
        It offers a unique opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to
        practical scenarios, which is crucial for mastering cloud engineering
        concepts and practices.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals for the School of Engineering Cloud Engineering Program</h2>
      <p>
        My primary goal for the School of Engineering program is to build a
        robust understanding of cloud infrastructure and services. I aim to
        become proficient in designing, deploying, and managing scalable and
        secure cloud environments. This includes gaining expertise in various
        cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I am eager to develop my skills in automation and DevOps
        practices, which are essential for efficient cloud operations. By the
        end of the program, I hope to have a strong portfolio of projects that
        demonstrate my ability to solve complex problems and implement effective
        cloud solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Networking with peers and professionals in the field is also a
        significant goal of mine. I believe that building a strong professional
        network will open up opportunities for collaboration, knowledge sharing,
        and career advancement. Ultimately, I aspire to leverage the knowledge
        and skills gained at Alt School to contribute to innovative projects and
        drive technological advancements in the cloud computing industry.
